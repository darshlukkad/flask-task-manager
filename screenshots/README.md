## How to Generate

Run the automated capture script:

```bash
# From project root
./capture-screenshots.sh

1. **Terminal Screenshots**:
   - `kubectl get pods -n task-manager`
   - `kubectl get svc -n task-manager`
   - `kubectl get all -n task-manager`

2. **Application Screenshots**:
   - Application homepage (http://localhost:30080)
   - Task list with different priorities
   - Task creation form
   - Task completion functionality
